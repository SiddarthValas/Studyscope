{"tasks": [], "note": "Software Crisis is a term used in computer science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to using the same workforce, same methods, and same tools even though rapidly increasing software demand, the complexity of software, and software challenges. With the increase in software complexity, many software problems arise because existing methods were insufficient. If we use the same workforce, same methods, and same tools after the fast increase in software demand, software complexity, and software challenges, then there arise some issues like software budget problems, software efficiency problems, software quality problems, software management, and delivery problems, etc. This condition is called a Software Crisis.", "burnout_logs": []}
